- Assuming each dual represents an edge of a graph, we can form a forest.

- Given, nodes belong to either one of the two sets(race); For each graph in the forest, we can traverse through the nodes and assign them to a set. Such that no two nodes of an edge belong to the same set.
- Sum of the **max cardinality of two sets for each graph** is the desired result.
